# Project-3220

2024 Data Science project by Claudia Nething, Revel Etheridge, Nol Paterson, Breanna Woosley, and Riley Grimaud. From a database on Goodreads books with their respective genres, titles, authors, review counts, etc., we sought to determine whether we could find a correlation between a book's popularity with the provided attributes. Random forest and KNN models were both explored after some data cleaning and EDA on the given dataset.
